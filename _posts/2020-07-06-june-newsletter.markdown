Welcome to the June issue of the Gravel Newsletter!

![banner](/assets/bannerLogo.jpg)

Hi there! As you may have noticed, this is the first Gravel Development Newsletter! My name is Roberto, I’m a Chemical Engineering major at Florida State University. I have a passion for making things, and I believe that creation is best when it’s shared.

**So, what exactly is Gravel?**

Gravel is a student companion application, currently targeted toward iOS users. Gravel aims to amplify the efficiency of your day by providing users with a single, concise space to track tasks, classes, grades, dates, assignments, and more. While Gravel’s basic features have already been determined, suggestions for new or alternative features are more than welcome! From sign-ups alone, I already received some awesome suggestions which I intend to draw into the concept art before adding them to the program.

**Sounds cool, what does it look like?**

So far, here is the first draft of concept art for Gravel. Cute right? Not really.

Think of it as an architect’s blueprint of a building. It’s not going to be very pretty, but it’ll tell the builders exactly where things are intended to be and a rough structure of what they should look like, and it’s up to them to bring the project to life. In development, the blueprints are a draft of the User Interface (UI) and they act as instructions to build the functions and methods that drive the app.

**What’s next?**

Up next is storyboarding and programming, the nitty gritty of development. My intention is to have the basic framework (buttons, input fields, etc.) placed and textured by the end of July, with the very first video demo in the next newsletter.

**That’s all, folks!**

If you have any questions or suggestions, definitely reach out via email and I’ll be happy to address them. Thanks for coming with me on this adventure!
