# You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

# Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

# `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

# Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

# Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

# {% highlight ruby %}
# def print_hi(name)
#  puts "Hi, #{name}"
# end
# print_hi('Tom')
# #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
# {% endhighlight %}

# Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

Hey there! Welcome to the first official update on the new site. I came to the realization that projects like Gravel (and hopefully other  future endeavors) deserve a place to call home besides my hard drive. Thankfully, GitHub has heard the prayers of developers with the same mentality and answered! GitHub Pages is an awesome git based web-hosting platform for developers. In addition, there's a Ruby Gem called Jekyll which allows for easy theme development and it integrates very nicely with GitHub. That's actually the Gem I used to design this site!

I will be using this site to discuss progress made on my active projects. At the  time of posting this update, I am developing my very first iOS app, [gravel](https://r-dms.github.io/gravel). As you'll read, it's a student companion app oriented toward task management and grade tracking. There's been a bunch of feature requests, each of which I intend to address in a future post.

Additionally, I'll be using this site as a place to share the tricks and stories I pick up as I learn more languages. If you haven't read the [about](https://r-dms.github.io/about) page, feel free to check it out! Everything will updated as I progress in development, so stay tuned.
