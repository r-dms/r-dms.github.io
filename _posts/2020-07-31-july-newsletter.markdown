Welcome to the July issue of the Gravel Newsletter!

**Hello again!**

Welcome back to another newsletter! This is gonna be a relatively short one since this month has been packed with non-gravel events and activities for me. First things first: what’s done? Here’s where we’re at so far: the framework for data storage has been sketched out and the different panels have been laid out on a paper storyboard (which I will not be showing because I would prefer not to share my lackluster artistic talent). In addition, the panel switching actions have been set up in XCode and the repository was updated with the starting files that come in a new XCode project. I also got the website up and running, which I'm pretty pleased with.

**Great, but is that it?**

You’re probably thinking to yourself, “well it doesn’t seem like he’s gotten much done on the app.” You’re right! I’m relatively new to development, so the majority of my time has been dedicated to mastering the basics and learning to navigate different development environments. I’ve also spent some time playing with the various developer kits that come with iOS so that, during development, I have as many tools as possible at my disposal. Now that I’ve gotten good at navigating these environments, I feel confident in developing more on Gravel.

**Awesome! When do we get to see a demo?**

The intention was to provide a video demo with this newsletter, but with a bunch of crazy stuff going on in my life, I wasn’t able to get a functional prototype together. I’m aiming to push out a functional prototype during August, but this is still uncertain because the coming month is going to be packed with work from my job and my school work. An email will be sent out when the functional prototype is finished, otherwise it will be included in next month’s newsletter.

**What’s next?**
Up next is a continuation storyboarding as well as laying down the code framework. I’d like to establish data fields and figure out how I’m going to be storing user inputs. In addition, I will be refining the textures on the application to have a more friendly and aesthetically pleasing look.

**That’s all, folks!**

If you have any questions or suggestions, definitely reach out via email and I’ll be happy to address them. Thanks for coming with me on this adventure!
