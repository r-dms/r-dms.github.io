Gravel is a student companion app in development. The app is targeted toward students in high school, college, and other forms of higher education.  

As of now, the concept art is in early drafts and the storyboarding is under construction. In addition, the feature list is still being built since I'm still collecting information with the intended features.

Below is an image of what some of the basic screens will look like, including a  calendar, to-do list, and course viewer.

As of now, this is the intended Feature List. Please note, this is not final. The majority of the things on this list will be moved, edited, changed, or deleted. In addition, there will be many more features added as the project progresses.
