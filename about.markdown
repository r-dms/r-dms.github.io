Hi there! I'm an undergraduate RA (Resident Assistant) studying Chemical Engineering at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Fl. As of September 2020, I am interning as a Research Assistant at the Center for Advanced Power Systems under Dr. Peter Cheetham. I am a hobbyist developer taking on one passion project at a time, and I'm here to make something meaningful.

This is my current active project, [Gravel](https://r-dms.github.io/gravel).

As a full-time student in a field wildly invested in chemistry and process analysis, I was looking to find a more creative outlet that was still challenging in a more technical way. I came across C++, and I got hooked on development. From there, I began working with the basics of Swift, Git, Unix, and a few Ruby Gems. While I still consider myself a novice, I've decided to begin working on a development project.

Gravel is the first of many intended projects, some of which will be related to Gravel, and others which may be completely new. I've come to love development, and I hope to carry and grow the skills I've learned into the future.
