As long as I can remember, I've always had a passion for logging, archiving, and recording the events in my life. These archives range from journals to photos and even video logs. I am proud of the work that has gone into my archive, particularly my journals. While I'd love to share my journals with the world, I they contain private information such as contacts and schedules which I would prefer to keep undisclosed. However, my videos depict past events, so there's no problem sharing those!

Here's an index of some of my videos, which feature different adventures or experiences I've had. I intend to continue expanding my library of videos as I get better with camera work and editing.
