As long as I can remember, I've always had a passion for logging, archiving, and recording the events in my life. These archives range from journals to photos and even video logs. I am proud of the work that has gone into my archive, particularly my journals. While I'd love to share my journals with the world, I they contain private information such as contacts and schedules which I would prefer to keep undisclosed. However, my videos depict past events, so there's no problem sharing those!

Here's an index of some of my videos, which feature different adventures or experiences I've had. I intend to continue expanding my library of videos as I get better with camera work and editing.

Toward the end of my senior year, my friends and I took a road trip to Cape Canaveral, FL and stayed in an amazing villa-style hotel. We went kayaking, explored the John F. Kennedy Space Center, and kicked back during our spring break.

Throughout high school, I participated in a business-oriented competition called DECA. One of my favorite parts of the competition was the traveling. I got to travel to Anaheim, Atlanta, and Orlando with awesome people and compete with people all over the world. For my last competition, the International Career Development Conference, I made a video to capture the awesome experience.

In contrast most university students, I opted to start my college experience in the summer of 2019. I met some amazing people and made incredible memories during my first summer at school. This video was captured on a tiny action camera and it was meant to have a summer camp vibe, because that's truly how my experience felt.

During my first fall semester, two of my friends and I took a road trip to North Carolina. This was my first college road trip, and it was my first time getting to experience the beautiful autumn in North Carolina.

When the covid-19 quarantine began, I designed and built a self sustaining ecosystem in a jar. After a few days, I took a sample of the ecosystem and found some microorganisms living their lives in the little bubble of a universe I had created.
